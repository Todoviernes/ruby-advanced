n whichever directory you are storing your work here at Wyncode, go ahead and create a world.rb file. We’re going to begin creating a new world. Open that file and create a class Person. This is the factory that people in your world will be made from. New Person are born by calling Person.new. Let’s create a new person sandy, by setting Person.new equal to sandy. When we make these Person, however, they don’t have any attributes. For example, let’s try to see what sandy’s hair color is by calling sandy.hair_color. You should get an error. So let’s give our Person class an attribute of hair_color so you can assign, read, and write sandy‘s hair_color (or any instance of the Person class). Now set sandy’s hair color. Submit all of your code in the world.rb file.
